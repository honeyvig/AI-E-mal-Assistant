n need of a product that user's can sign up for and integrate with their existing Gmail or Outlook accounts. The main goals of the product are to:

- be able to separate between emails that need follow up/responses vs marketing emails

- create folders/labels

- create accurate responses to emails as a draft

Essentially, we would like to clone all of the email features outlined on fyxer.ai

To create a product that integrates with Gmail or Outlook accounts to help users manage their emails by sorting important ones (needing follow-up), creating labels or folders, and drafting accurate responses, we can break down the implementation into several components. We will need:

    User Authentication: To integrate with Gmail or Outlook, we need to authenticate users and access their emails. This can be done using OAuth2 for Gmail and Microsoft for Outlook.

    Email Categorization: We will classify emails into different categories like "Follow-up" and "Marketing" using machine learning or rule-based algorithms.

    Folder/Label Creation: This feature allows users to create folders or labels to organize their emails.

    Drafting Responses: Using NLP models (such as OpenAI's GPT or other AI-based models), we can generate drafts for responses based on the email content.

We'll use Python to build the backend of the system, relying on libraries and APIs like:

    Google API Client for Gmail integration.
    Microsoft Graph API for Outlook integration.
    OpenAI API or other NLP models for email response generation.

High-Level Overview:

    User Sign Up/Login: User authenticates through OAuth2 for Gmail/Outlook.
    Email Categorization: Sort incoming emails into categories (Follow-up/Marketing).
    Folder/Label Management: Allow the user to create and manage email folders/labels.
    Email Response Generation: Generate draft responses based on incoming email content.

1. Setting up Gmail API Integration (OAuth2)

First, you’ll need to set up access to the Gmail API. You can follow Google's quickstart guide for Python to create credentials and enable the Gmail API.

Once you've set that up, you can use the google-auth and google-api-python-client libraries to interact with Gmail.
Install Required Libraries:

pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

Code to Authenticate and Access Gmail:

import os
import pickle
import base64
import time
import re
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError

# If modifying these SCOPES, delete the file token.pickle.
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify']

def authenticate_gmail():
    """Authenticate the user with Gmail using OAuth2."""
    creds = None
    # The file token.pickle stores the user's access and refresh tokens, and is
    # created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first time.
    if os.path.exists('token.pickle'):
        with open('token.pickle', 'rb') as token:
            creds = pickle.load(token)
    # If there are no (valid) credentials available, let the user log in.
    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
                'credentials.json', SCOPES)
            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
        # Save the credentials for the next run
        with open('token.pickle', 'wb') as token:
            pickle.dump(creds, token)
    try:
        # Call the Gmail API
        service = build('gmail', 'v1', credentials=creds)
        return service
    except HttpError as error:
        print(f'An error occurred: {error}')
        return None

This will authenticate users via OAuth2 and allow access to their Gmail account.
2. Email Categorization (Follow-Up vs Marketing)

We can classify emails into categories like "Follow-up" and "Marketing" based on content. A basic rule-based approach might classify emails by looking for certain keywords, but a more sophisticated approach would involve training a model to classify the emails.

Here’s an example of a simple rule-based categorization:

def classify_email(email_subject, email_body):
    """Classify email as 'Follow-up' or 'Marketing'."""
    follow_up_keywords = ['follow up', 'urgent', 'reply', 'response', 'action required']
    marketing_keywords = ['sale', 'discount', 'offer', 'free', 'promotion', 'buy now']
    
    # Convert subject and body to lowercase for matching
    email_text = (email_subject + " " + email_body).lower()

    # Simple rule-based categorization
    if any(keyword in email_text for keyword in follow_up_keywords):
        return 'Follow-up'
    elif any(keyword in email_text for keyword in marketing_keywords):
        return 'Marketing'
    else:
        return 'Other'

You can extend this categorization using machine learning algorithms (such as fine-tuned models from OpenAI) for better accuracy.
3. Folder/Label Creation

To create labels or folders, we will interact with Gmail’s API.
Code to Create Label in Gmail:

def create_label(service, label_name):
    """Create a new label in Gmail."""
    label = {
        "labelListVisibility": "labelShow",
        "messageListVisibility": "show",
        "name": label_name
    }
    try:
        label_object = service.users().labels().create(userId='me', body=label).execute()
        print(f'Created label: {label_object["name"]}')
    except HttpError as error:
        print(f'An error occurred: {error}')

This will allow users to create new labels/folders for email organization.
4. Drafting Responses (Using OpenAI GPT for Email Replies)

Once an email is categorized, you can generate a draft response using a pre-trained model like GPT-3/4 from OpenAI.
Code to Generate Email Response Using OpenAI:

import openai

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

def generate_email_response(email_body):
    """Generate a draft email response using GPT."""
    prompt = f"Draft a professional response to the following email: {email_body}"
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # Or another GPT model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

This function uses OpenAI's GPT-3/4 API to generate a response draft based on the email body.
5. Putting It All Together: Full Workflow

    User Sign-up and Authentication: Users sign up and authenticate using Gmail OAuth2.
    Email Fetching and Categorization: Fetch emails, categorize them as "Follow-up" or "Marketing".
    Folder Creation: Allow users to create custom folders/labels for emails.
    Draft Responses: Use OpenAI to generate accurate email responses based on email content.

Here’s a simple main script that ties these components together:

def main():
    service = authenticate_gmail()
    if service:
        # Fetch messages from Gmail (this is just an example, implement pagination for more)
        results = service.users().messages().list(userId='me', labelIds=['INBOX'], q="is:unread").execute()
        messages = results.get('messages', [])
        
        for message in messages:
            msg = service.users().messages().get(userId='me', id=message['id']).execute()
            email_subject = ''
            email_body = ''
            
            for header in msg['payload']['headers']:
                if header['name'] == 'Subject':
                    email_subject = header['value']
            
            # Extract email body
            for part in msg['payload']['parts']:
                if 'body' in part and 'data' in part['body']:
                    email_body = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(part['body']['data']).decode('utf-8')
            
            # Classify email
            category = classify_email(email_subject, email_body)
            print(f"Email classified as: {category}")
            
            if category == 'Follow-up':
                # Generate response
                response = generate_email_response(email_body)
                print(f"Generated Response: {response}")
                # Here, you could create a draft using the Gmail API
            elif category == 'Marketing':
                print("This is a marketing email.")
                # Move to a specific marketing folder/label, if needed
                create_label(service, 'Marketing')

Next Steps

    User Interface: You can build a front-end using frameworks like React or Flask to allow users to interact with the system.
    Real-Time Email Monitoring: You might want to implement a webhook or a service to monitor incoming emails in real-time.
    Enhance Categorization: Use machine learning models (e.g., fine-tuning GPT-3) for more accurate email categorization and response generation.

This code provides a foundational structure to build an AI-powered email management tool that helps users efficiently manage their inbox by categorizing emails, creating labels, and drafting responses.
